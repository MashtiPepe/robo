**********Known Issues:

The encoder feedback is not quadrature.  If the robot bumps into anything and the wheel turns, we
loose position.  Also, if one wheel turns and the other does not, then the radius of the turn
will be different than when both wheels turn.  These factors contibute to slow drift of the known
orientation of the robot.


**********Operation:

- Always plug a monitor to the Jetson before powering it up.
  This will help define the screen size for later access via
  VNC
  
- Power up the Jetson with the battery pack

- Connect the Jetson to your Wifi
  once connected, note the IP address of the Jetson
  you can get the IP address using the following command
  ifconfig
  
- Open a terminal on the Jetson and type the following command
  ~/openvino
  this will enable VNC access
  
- Connect the robot cord to a USB port on the Jetson

- Open another terminal on the Jetson
  type the following command
  cd robo
  this will change the directory to robo
  
- Optionally, download the latest program by typing the following:
  git pull origin master
  
- Execute the robo program by typing this command
  sudo python3 robo.py
  when asked for password type
  no
  Jetson password is no
  
- unplug the monitor from the Jetson

- Connect to the Jetson using VNC

- Place the robot on the floor and 
  click the "explore" button.
  The robot will explore a radius of 2.5 meters
